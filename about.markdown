I started this blog to occasionally write about new things I learn, or old things I remember. I've found that writing can help me organize my thoughts and cement new learnings.

I'm a builder at heart, and these days I spend a lot of my time building software. A lot of what I write will probably be software-related, though not always related to my work. In fact, one of my goals is to dedicate some time to playing with things that aren't related to work, and I'm hoping this space will encourage me to do that.

Although the target audience for this is pretty much just me, I'd love to hear from you if you have any thoughts about anything I write. My email address is gbrova at gmail dot com.
